    This may be a sheet from a consignment log at the warehouse in which a
    staff member has logged two different deliveries of grain in
    installments pertaining to a total amount committed that is 388
    *mann *of grain, from the three individuals mentioned
    above. If the recto side was written before the verso, then the
    staff member went back to the recto side and
    "corrected" the total original amount committed from
    375 to 388 [our reading of the number "8" in 388 is
    uncertain due to poor legibility of the overwritten text], but
    then forgot to correct this on the verso side, thus leaving 375 as
    the total. The note on the amount delivered on the recto side was
    corrected by the scribe from 170, to 172, to finally 173. The
    latter number when subtracted from a total aggregate consignment
    amount of 388 would give us the 215 recorded as delivered on the
    verso. If this is what happened, then it would imply that the
    verso is a record of the final installment of the 388 *mann
    *consignment from this particular township, which would make
    this the final log entry on it.

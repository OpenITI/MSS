    Three legal queries (*istiftā*) regarding the "triple
    repudiation" (*sih ṭalāq*), one of the forms of
    Islamic divorce. By pronouncing the *ṭalāq *formula three
    times in immediate succession, the divorce instantly takes effect.
    The questions are addressed to a certain judge (*qāḍī*) and
    religious scholar (*ʿālim*), who is not mentioned by name.
    Each answer, be it positive or negative, is written in short at
    the end of the question. In the second and third questions, the
    answer is followed by the Arabic phrase "God knows
    best" (*wa-llāhu aʿlam*). The questions
    regarding the triple repudiation in immediate succession reflects
    the controversy around this practice in Islam, as it was forbidden
    by some schools of law. Accordingly, the first question concerns
    the validity of the triple *ṭalāq *when pronouncing the
    formula consecutively. In the second question, the writer asks
    whether a man may take his wife back after performing the tripe
    *ṭalāq *and calling her "mother." This question
    raises yet another problematic form of divorce which was common in
    the pre-Islamic era - the *ẓihār*. The ẓihār is the
    designation of an oath said by the husband to his wife: "You
    are (forbidden) to me like my mother 's back" (*anti
    ʿalayya ka-ẓahri ummī*). The third question is not fully
    preserved. It probably concerns the validity of the triple
    *ṭalāq *when it is pronounced by the wife, whom her husband
    grants her the right to divorce (*al-amr bil-yad*). This
    assumption is confirmed by the appearance of the term amr in the
    opening clause of the question: "A man grants his wife the
    right (to divorce)" (*mard-ī amr zan-i khwad
    rā ba-dast kard*). The answers to the question are
    written in a different hand, apparently that of the judge
    mentioned in the first question. The first two questions are
    positively answered.

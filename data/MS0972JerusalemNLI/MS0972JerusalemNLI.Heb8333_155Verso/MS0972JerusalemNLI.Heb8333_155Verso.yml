    A letter from ʿAlī b. ʿUmar to Amīn al-Mulk, Muʿtamid al-Dawla (the
    name is missing due to a lacuna in the text). The sender mentions
    the threats made by Shujāʿ al-Mulk Ḥasan and asks the recipient to
    reprimand Ḥasan. He also affirms his loyalty, stating that he is
    simply fulfilling his duties and nothing more. However, if the
    recipient demands, he is willing to relocate to another village.
    Additionally, the sender requests two *khawār *of wheat
    from the recipient.

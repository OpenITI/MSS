90#MS#COMMENT####: Rotulus sheet of paper, complete, black ink; two pieces of paper glued
    together, written on reused paper
    This document records the court proceedings and the judge 's
    ruling in a litigation case about a dispute on the ownership and
    use of a share in a mill. The claimant is a woman who is
    represented by a male guardian. The judge rules in favour of the
    defendant, who has brought two witnesses to support his claim that
    the woman 's husband had sold this share to him in her
    presence. The document reveals a close alignment with rules on
    documenting court hearings in *fiqh *literature.

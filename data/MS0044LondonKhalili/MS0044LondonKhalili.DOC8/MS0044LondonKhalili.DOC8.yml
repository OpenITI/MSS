90#MS#COMMENT####: Written on leather, the writing surface shows fold lines and tears.
    In this document, Samsit, an inhabitant of Mahon, promises not to do
    harm to Tak son of Bet, an inhabitant of Madr, his family, and
    properties. The document was made at the court of the khars of
    Rob, showing that Mahon and Madr were under the jurisdiction of
    Rob. Two of the three witnesses bear Turkic titles, as the region
    was under control of the Turks. Among the dated Bactrian
    documents, this is the earliest that falls in the Islamic period.
    At this time, however, Islam exerted no influence in this area.

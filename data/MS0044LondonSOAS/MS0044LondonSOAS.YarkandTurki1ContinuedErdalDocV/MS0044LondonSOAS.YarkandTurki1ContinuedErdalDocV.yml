90#MS#COMMENT####: According to Erdal, the document was rolled up and pressed flat, then
    its ends were flattened and folded over.
    Fragment of a land sale document consisting of 13 witness statements.
    According to Erdal, this document has a preceding Arabic text
    which was available to another editor but was lost by the time
    Erdal was writing. This is one of six land sale documents written
    in the late eleventh century, collected by Denison Ross, of which
    photos were kept at SOAS. Formally, these documents differ from
    the non-Muslim deeds of land sale in the collection, which
    according to Erdal follow Chinese models. Erdal used these photos
    while the whereabouts of the originals were (and remain) unknown.
    Provenance seems to be a garden outside Yarkand where the
    documents were found in 1911. For details, see Erdal 's
    article (see Publications).

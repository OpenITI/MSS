90#MS#COMMENT####: Fragment (top part is missing).
    A fragment of an almost complete land sale document concerning the
    sale of a grove for the price of 150 *yarmaqs*. This
    is one of six land sale documents written in the late eleventh
    century, collected by Denison Ross, of which photos were kept at
    SOAS. Formally, these documents differ from the non-Muslim deeds
    of land sale in the collection, which according to Erdal follow
    Chinese models. Erdal used these photos while the whereabouts of
    the originals were (and remain) unknown. Provenance seems to be a
    garden outside Yarkand where the documents were found in
    1911. For details, see Erdal 's article (see Publications).

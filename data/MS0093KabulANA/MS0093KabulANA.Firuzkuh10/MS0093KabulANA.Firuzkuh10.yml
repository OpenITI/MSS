    Khwaja Muhammad.
    The parties to this *iqrār* document are a husband and wife who
    are both of very high social standing. The husband is a senior
    military official. His wife seems to have brought a grievance that
    her husband has been neglecting her. She has managed to get her
    husband to agree to either drop the neglect or give her a divorce.
    She even managed to receive the delegated authority to request a
    divorce, which is usually only in the husband 's purview.<br

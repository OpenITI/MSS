    written by Mirza Khwaja Muhammad in ballpoint pen.
    An order sent from al-Dīwān *al-Ikhtiyārī* to the
    *muʿtamid* ʿAlī b. ʿAbd al-Rashīd on three different tasks:
    1) to collect 450 *mann* belonging to the sons of a certain
    Abū Bakr from Khāy, which is currently held by the sons of
    Muḥammad b. Khiḍr from the village of Pūza-yi ʿUlyā (perhaps as a
    loan?); 2) to collect 100 *mann* from Ḥusayn b. Yaʿqūb,
    which the latter has borrowed from an unnamed individual; 3) to
    collect four sheep.

90#MS#COMMENT####: Incomplete (bottom part missing), black ink
    Fragment of the middle part of a decree discussing the kinship rights
    of the son of a lord, probably killed, and confirming the validity
    of the late lord 's appointment of a high official titled
    *majlis-i rafīʿ*. Mayhanī (1350/1971, p. 11) seems to place
    this *majlis-i rafīʿ* at a low level of the top tier of the
    administrative chain of command. Although it is unclear who the
    sender and recipient are, the format (i.e., wide spacing between
    lines) and terminology (i.e., *majlis-i rafīʿ*) imply that
    this decree was issued from a high-level at the sultan 's
    court. Two possible scenarios as to the sender 's identity
    may be suggested: 1) the decree was issued on behalf of the high
    official titled *majlis-i rafīʿ*, confirming his
    appointment and ensuring the rights of the late prince 's
    son; or 2) the decree was issued on behalf of the young prince,
    ensuring the continuation of the *majlis-i rafīʿ*,
    following the passing of his father. Other similar
    documents will be compared in the future. For now, see Qāʾim-
    maqāmī 1971: 44-49 (s.v., "mithāl").

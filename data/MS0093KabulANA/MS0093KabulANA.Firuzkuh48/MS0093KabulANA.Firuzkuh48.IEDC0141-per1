#META# contentSummary: A receipt indicating payment of 149 *mann* of fodder grain paid by Abū Bakr b. Muḥammad b. Yaʿqūb to ʿAlī b. ʿAbd al-Rashīd. The latter is titled here *khwāja*, although documents issued by al-Dīwān al-Ikhtiyārī refer to him as *muʿtamid*. Significantly, the receipt lacks a few elements that are typical of administrative documents in general and receipts in particular: 1) an invocation on the top of the document; 2) validation signs (e.g., the Arabic verbal form *ṣaḥḥa*); 3) a clause indicating that the receipt can serve as evidence (*ḥujjat*). The absence of invocation and issuing authority suggests that perhaps the top part of this fragment has been lost.

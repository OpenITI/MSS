 Legal query (*istiftā*) regarding an exchange of two
    plots of land between two parties. After ten years, a claimant
    - likely one of the original parties - demands the
    harvest (*nuzul*) not only from the plot of land he
    originally owned, and probably still possesses (*ṣāhib
    milk*), but also from the plot he received in exchange. The
    query seeks clarification on whether the claimant has the right to
    take the harvest from the second plot, given that he has already
    collected the harvest from the first. The response, written by
    Muḥammad b. Abū Bakr, rules that the claim is invalid. An
    additional explanation by Shihāb b. Awḥad states that the claimant
    cannot collect the harvest from the second plot because he did not
    sow seeds in it, and ownership of crops is tied to the act of
    cultivation.

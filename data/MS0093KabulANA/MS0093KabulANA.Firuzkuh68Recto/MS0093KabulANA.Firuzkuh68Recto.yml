    Fragmentary letter seemingly about the theft of cropped wheat from a
    farm. The sender is expressing his innocence to the landlord on
    behalf of his community of gleaners, and suggests that others have
    been taking the wheat late at night. He says that if the landlord
    does not believe him and wants to punish them, they are willing to
    vacate the property.
